# elfw-js

A functional web app framework with non-retained view system.

* Its an experiment in deconstruction. What are the smallest cogs for a web framework? How can they be composed of custom bits?

* Be unopinionated: The framework creator has less context about than the problem then the app developer.

* Have some guides: Give the developer a base set of tools that build on the basics of the framework cogs, and are geared towards a specific problem domain.
